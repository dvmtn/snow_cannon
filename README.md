Snow Cannon
===========
A Simple includable library that loads some arbitrary JSON onto a page.

Setup
-----

To run locally see [Carabiner](http://github.com/dvmtn/carabiner) it'll deploy using Grunt Source.

The sample webpage uses a small included script to make an XHR request for some data then injects it into the assigned element.

The options to be passed to SnowCannon() in your js file are as follows:

| Option     | Default | Explanation                                                 |
| ---------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| theme      | 'light' | 'light' or 'dark', more themes will be on the way           |
| element_id | n/a     | The id of the container element you wish to use as a string |
| api_key    | n/a     | Currently unused eventually snowcannon will restrict access |

Side Note
---------

This is very much a play project exploring useful ideas, it's further development is definitely not guaranteed!
